# Agentic-RAG-System
An Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that uses a multi-step reasoning pipeline:  Planner → Tool Use → Critic (Retry Loop) → Final Answer  Built with LangGraph, LangChain, FAISS, Ollama, and Streamlit, this app lets you upload documents (PDF/TXT), build a vector index, and ask questions with verifiable, citation-backed answers.
